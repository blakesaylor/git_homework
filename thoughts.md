Breakout sessions are great for collaborative work and learning others experiences and perspectives.

Git is a super helpful tool for tracking changes rather than having a bunch of files named with update dates (file x version 2, file x version 3, etc.)

Calendaring will be necessary for building a balanced and productive schedule while at Turing.

Make sure to budget time for fitness and personal health at least three times a week

Review what I've learned periodically to keep a healthy perspective on where I started and where I am at that time

A quick shoutout to Mike Bonini -- Seems like we keep ending up in the same breakout rooms. Mike has been super helpful by offering a differing perspective / way of thinking than my own, all while being a wonderfully pleasant and nice person.
